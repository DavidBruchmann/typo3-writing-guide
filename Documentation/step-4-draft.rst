Step 4: Draft
=============

This is when the writing begins. Use the outline from the brief to
create your structure and start adding details and evidence around your
supporting points. Connect your points, adding headlines and subheads
last.

It’s usually easiest to fill in the body of your piece before drafting
the headline and introduction, but follow your intuition as to what
works best for you. Make sure to read your draft thoroughly and copy
edit before handing it over for review.

Get through your first draft quickly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the first stage of draft creation, don’t worry about language or
polish—just get the ideas fully formed onto the page. Once you’re done
with round one, you can self-edit and add more stylistic touches before
handing it over for internal review.

Leave a guide for your editors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mark up any problem areas or queries you may have for the editor.
They’ll likely have a fresh viewpoint and help you overcome challenges
like word choices or troublesome sentences.

The best writing is often the result of collaboration. Don’t be shy
about telling your reviewer where you are stuck or where you need
something: examples, a case study, whatever it is that would take your
piece from good to great!
