Step 3: Brief Review and Approval
=================================

Whenever possible, stakeholders or peers should review your brief. The
brief is, by nature, brief, so this is not a long time commitment and
provides a valuable opportunity for course correction. A peer review can
help make certain the brief makes sense, and identify missed
opportunities or supporting points.
