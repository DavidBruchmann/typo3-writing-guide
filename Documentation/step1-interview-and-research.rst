Step 1: Interview and Research
==============================

Research and conduct interviews to gain a deeper understanding of
technical concepts and to develop a sense of the potential narrative. To
prepare for an interview, you can read materials related to the subject
(e.g., documentation, previous publications by the subject-matter
experts, or related blog posts.) This research informs your interview
questions.

Interviews with subject-matter experts (SMEs) form the backbone of
empathic communication and technical accuracy. The people weâ€™re
interviewing may be experts directly involved in a given product, or
they may be product users. Each speaks from experience, providing
anecdotal proof and compelling stories. Throughout an interview, the
shape of a narrative will usually emerge as we ask our SMEs exploratory
questions, for example:

-  What problem or task were you faced with?
-  How did you think about possible solutions?
-  How did you choose or implement a solution?
-  How did the solution develop as the project progressed?
-  Who/what helped you get it done?
-  What difference has it made for you, your customers, or your peers?
